# Garmin-Data-Analysis

This repository contains a Python notebook where I analyze my Garmin fitness data, focusing on trends in step count, resting heart rate, active hours, and stress levels throughout 2024. As a fitness enthusiast recovering from an ACL injury, I wanted to explore how my activity levels have impacted both my recovery and overall well-being.

Key Insights: <br>
-**Step Count & Resting Heart Rate**: Identified the optimal daily step range (6-7k steps) that correlates with a lower resting heart rate (~35-40 bpm). <br>
-**Active Hours & Stress Levels**: Observed a significant drop in stress levels when daily active hours exceed 2, which serves as my new fitness goal.

What's Included:  <br>
Data preprocessing (cleaning and filtering)  <br>
Time-series analysis of activity and stress trends  <br>
Visualizations showing correlations between fitness metrics  <br>
Outlier detection to ensure data quality  <br>
